# Expense Tracker App

Welcome to the **Expense Tracker App** project, part of my [FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) journey!

## Project Overview

In this project, I developed a **Beginner-Friendly Expense Tracker App** to help users manage and monitor their personal finances effectively. This application not only tracks expenses but also introduces essential Python programming concepts, enhancing both functionality and code readability.

## Features

- **Add Expenses**: Easily add new expenses with descriptions and amounts.
- **List all expenses**: Display a list of all recorded expenses.
- **Show total expenses**: Automatically calculate the total expenses.
- **Filter expenses by category**: Easy to read and separate expanses by category.
- **Delete Expenses**: Remove any unwanted expenses from the tracker.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive command-line interface for ease of use.


## Key Concepts Covered

- **Lambda Functions**: Utilized lambda functions for concise and efficient data processing.
- **Modular Programming**: Organized code into separate functions to enhance readability and maintainability.
- **Data Structures**: Managed expenses using lists, functions and dictionaries.
