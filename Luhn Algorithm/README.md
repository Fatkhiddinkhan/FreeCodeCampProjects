# Luhn Algorithm Validator

Welcome to the **Luhn Algorithm Validator** project, part of my [FreeCodeCamp Scientific Computing with Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) journey!

## Project Overview

In today's project, I implemented the **Luhn Algorithm**, a widely used method for validating identification numbers such as credit card numbers. This script is concise, consisting of approximately **30 lines of Python code**, and serves as a fundamental tool for verifying the legitimacy of various card and bank account numbers.

## What is the Luhn Algorithm?

The Luhn Algorithm, also known as the **modulus 10** or **mod 10** algorithm, is a simple checksum formula used to validate a variety of identification numbers. It helps detect simple errors in input, such as mistyped digits.

### How It Works

1. **Starting from the right**, double every second digit.
2. **If doubling a digit results in a number greater than 9**, subtract 9 from it.
3. **Sum all the digits**.
4. **If the total sum is divisible by 10**, the number is valid according to the Luhn formula.

### Example

- **Number**: 4539 1488 0343 6467
- **Validation**: Valid

## Features

- **Validation of Identification Numbers**: Checks the validity of credit card numbers, bank account numbers, and other identification sequences.
- **Simple and Efficient**: A lightweight script with only about 30 lines of code.
- **User-Friendly**: Easy to use with clear input and output instructions.
- **Error Detection**: Quickly identifies invalid numbers to prevent fraudulent activities.

## How It Works

1. **Input**: Provide the identification number you wish to validate.
2. **Processing**:
   - The script processes the number using the Luhn Algorithm steps.
   - It handles both even and odd-length numbers gracefully.
3. **Output**: Returns whether the provided number is **valid** or **invalid** based on the algorithm.
