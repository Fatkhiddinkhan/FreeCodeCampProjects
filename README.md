# FreeCodeCamp â€“ Scientific Computing with Python

Welcome to my repository, where I am documenting my journey through the **Scientific Computing with Python** projects from [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/)! 

## Overview

I recently discovered FreeCodeCamp and decided to use it to strengthen my Python skills. I aim to complete **3 to 4 projects per week** to consistently build upon my knowledge and recall any concepts I might have forgotten. This repository contains my solutions and notes for each project in the Scientific Computing with Python curriculum.

## Why FreeCodeCamp?

- **Structured Learning**: FreeCodeCamp provides clear, progressive lessons and projects.  
- **Hands-on Projects**: Each project offers real-world scenarios to apply new concepts.  
- **Skill Reinforcement**: Great for recalling previously learned topics and solidifying them with practice.  
- **Community Support**: A supportive community of learners and mentors.

## What This Repository Covers

1. **Data Analysis and Manipulation**  
   Learn to handle and process data using various Python libraries and techniques.

2. **Data Structures & Algorithms**  
   Practice using built-in data structures (lists, dictionaries, sets, etc.) and gain insights into algorithmic thinking.

3. **Object-Oriented Programming**  
   Understand classes, objects, inheritance, and other OOP concepts to build modular and reusable code.

4. **Complex Calculations and Tools**  
   Develop the ability to solve challenging problems using powerful Python tools and libraries, ensuring efficient performance.
